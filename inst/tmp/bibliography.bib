  abstract  = {Gas compressibility factor (z-factor) is an important parameter widely used in petroleum and chemical engineering. Accurate and fast calculation of this parameter is of crucial need and challenges a large number of simulators used in petroleum engineering.
The Standing–Katz chart was published in 1942 and since then has been considered an industry standard. Several methods have been tried and developed to calculate z-factor by fitting models on the smoothed Standing–Katz data. Some of these models are the Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem (DAK), the Nishiumi–Saito, the Nishiumi, and the Brill–Beggs correlations. All models developed afterwards the Standing–Katz charts present some limitation like instability close to certain boundaries, convergence, and/or accuracy. In fact, different correlations tend to fit better to a particular area of the domain for Ppr and Tpr (pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature), but fail badly close and beyond to their limits. Also, most correlations require iterative procedures to obtain the corresponding z-factor, and may even present different results dependent on the initial guess for the initial iteration. The DAK correlation is one of the most widely used models.
In this study we propose and develop a methodology to obtain z-factors for Natural Hydrocarbon Gases using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Data obtained directly from the Standing–Katz and Katz compressibility charts were used to train several topologies of ANN. The input parameters in the ANN are the pseudo- reduced pressure and temperature and the output is the z-factor. Two of the successful networks have two hidden layers. The first ANN uses five neurons in each hidden layer and the second ANN uses ten neurons in each hidden layer (called 2-5-5-1 and 2-10-10-1 networks respectively). These topologies were trained with the data from the charts using a back-propagation training algorithm. The results are compared with the charts (with values not used during the training section), along with the results obtained using DAK correlation. In addition, performance comparisons were made between the ANN model and the DAK correlation. In both situations, the ANN models are superior to the DAK correlation. In addition, the ANN model covers a wider range of Ppr and Tpr, which surpasses the limits of all other correlations together. Typically, the time needed to obtain results for a 2-5-5-1 network corresponds to the time of one single iteration needed for the DAK correlation. The paper discusses these results, and provides the weight sets (values of synapses and biases) needed to reproduce the ANN, which can be easily implemented in an electronic spreadsheet.},

  abstract  = {The compressibility factor of natural gases is necessary in many petroleum engineering calculations. Some of these calculations are the following: evaluation of a newly discovered formation, pressure drop from flow of gas through a pipe, pressure gradient in gas wells, gas metering, gas compression, and processing. Typically, the gas compressibility factor is measured by laboratory experiments. These experiments are expensive and time-consuming. Occasionally, experimental data became unavailable and the gas compressibility factor is estimated from correlations using gas composition or gas gravity. This paper presents new methods for calculating the gas compressibility factors for gas condensates at any temperature and pressure. The method is based on compositional analysis of 1200 compositions of gas condensates collected worldwide. When the gas composition is known, this study presents a simple mixing rule to calculate the pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. The new mixing rule accounts for the presence of the heptane plus fraction and none hydrocarbons. In case the gas composition is unavailable, the study presents a new gas gravity correlation to estimate pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. This study also presents an evaluation of eight methods to characterize the plus fraction, three widely used mixing rules, and six methods to calculate the gas compressibility factor. Thus, this study presents an evaluation of one hundred forty-four possible methods of calculating the gas compressibility factor for gas condensates. The accuracy of the new mixing rule and the gas gravity correlation has been compared to other published methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed methods are consistent and provide accurate results.},

  abstract = {Compressibility factor (z-factor) values of natural gases are necessary in most petroleum engineering calculations. The most common sources of z-factor values are experimental measurement, equations of state method and empirical correlations. Necessity arises when there is no available experimental data for the required composition, pressure and temperature conditions. Presented here is a technique to predict z-factor values of pure substances, natural gases and sour reservoir gases regardless of the composition of the acid gases at all temperatures and pressures.
 Eight equations of state have been thoroughly examined and the results suggest that the Lawal-Lake-Silberberg (LLS-EOS) equation of state is capable of predicting z-factor values of both pure substances and mixtures of gases. This equation of state method allows the determination of reduced temperature (TR) and reduced pressure (PR) instead of the pseudo-reduced temperature (TPR) and pseudo-reduced pressure (PPR) both for pure substances and mixtures of gases. This EOS is robust and the results are accurate even if of acid gases present in high concentration. A comparative z-factor prediction result of the various EOS methods for different gas samples is presented fortifying the capability of the LLS-EOS method. Another method of predicting z-factor values is based on the famous Standing-Katz (S-K) Chart (empirical methods). Law of Corresponding States principle has formed the basis to develop a universal adjustable parameter. This developed adjustable parameter forms the basis for using LLS-EOS to be able to use S-K Chart to predict accurate z-factor values of pure substances and mixtures of gases regardless of the concentration of acid gases. In contrast to the existing methods derived from other equations of states (EOS methods) and S-K Chart (empirical methods), this project provides a simple and universal technique for predicting z-factor values for pure substances, natural gases and sour reservoir gases.},

Several mixing rules and gas gravity correlations available in the literature are first evaluated and compared. The evaluation is performed on a large database consisting of more than 2106 samples of sour gas compositions collected worldwide. Several evaluation criteria are used including the average absolute deviation (AAD), the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of correlation, R, and cross plots and error histograms. The mixing rules include: Kay's mixing rule combined with Wichert–Aziz correlation for the presence of non-hydrocarbons, SSBV mixing rule with Wichert and Aziz, Corredor et al. mixing rule, and Piper et al. mixing rule. These methods, in one form or another, use information on gas composition. Three different other methods that are based on gas gravity alone were also analyzed. These are: Standing, Sutton, and Elsharkawy et al. gas gravity correlations. While the methods based on knowledge of composition showed reasonable accuracy, those based on gas gravity alone showed weak accuracy with low correlation coefficients. A new gas gravity correlation that is based on the fraction of non-hydrocarbons present in the sour gas was proposed. Preliminary results indicate that a good improvement over past gravity correlations was achieved. The compositional correlations, still show, however, better accuracy. Research is still going on to come up with more accurate correlations that are based on only readily available descriptors.},

  abstract  = {Density data are reported on 16 saturated hydrocarbon vapors at pressuresranging from 1000 to 8220 lb. per sq. in. and at temperatures ranging from 35?to 250?F. These data have been used to extend the compressibility-factor chartfor natural gases up to 10,000 lb. per sq. in. The relatively large quantity ofhigh-boiling constituents present in high-pressure vapors in equilibrium withcrude oils makes it necessary to include in the analysis of the gas themolecular weight, density, and possibly boiling range of the heptanes andheavier fraction. Relationships have been presented by which the density ofgases may be obtained directly from the temperature, pressure, and gas gravityprovided the gases have a common source or are similar in composition.IntroductionThe densities of natural gases are necessary in many engineeringcomputations in petroleum production and utilization. Gas reserves, changes inreservoir pressure, gradients in gas wells, metering of gases, pipeline flow,and compression of gases are typical problems requiring the density of the gas.A decade ago, engineering computations used ideal gas laws with deviations upto 500 lb. per sq. in. Recent discoveries of pools having pressures up to 7500lb. per sq. in., and installation of pressure-maintenance and recycling plants,have increased the need for data on gas density at high pressures.Methods Of ComputationThe accepted method of computing the density or specific volume of naturalgases is the use of the ideal gas law corrected by a compressibility factor.The method proposed by Kay of correlating compressibility factors for gaseousmixtures on pseudo critical properties appears to be satisfactory for naturalgases. The methane-compressibility factor has been shown to deviatesystematically from the behavior of natural gases and a chart giving thesecorrected factors is available.A method of computing specific volume of gaseous mixtures from partial molalvolumes has been reported by Sage and Lacey. Complete data for the computationare not yet available for all hydrocarbon gases.Most of the reported data on gas densities have been in the single-phaseregion removed from the dew point or saturation condition. Since most gases inthe reservoir or while on contact with liquid during flow are saturated, thedetermination of densities under conditions of saturation is particularlyimportant.T.P. 1323},

A comparison is made of the performance of the Hall and Yarborough, Dranchuk et al. and above-mentioned methods, and the results are discussed.COMPRESSIBILITY FACTORS have been calculated by means of computer for almost twenty-five years(l). During this period, the techniques available for effecting such calculations have been gradually improved and refined. In the recent past, experimental data have been fitted with various equations of state and these fitted equations have been used to generate Z factors(2,3,4,5). These equations represent a significant step forward in that they may be used as algebraic expressions for Z in dealing with its functions.As most of these fittings have been made using the Standing and Katz correlation or data in the same region, their application would appear to be restricted to that region. However, there are occasions when Z is required outside this region. Consequently, the object of this study was to examine the extent to which these equations could be extrapolated and to try modified fittings which would extend the region of application.Preliminary examination showed that the Redlich Kwong equation could not be generally compared with the Standing and Katz correlation, because it is not expressed in reduced form. Furthermore, this equation could not be tested against experimental data where critical properties rather than gas analyses are reported. In view of these problems, this equation was eliminated from further study.It was observed that the Hankinson et al. fitting of the BWR equation was restricted to the region 1.1 ≤ Tr ≤3.0 and that the manner of fitting was such that errors in Z in the fitted region were considerably higher than those produced by either the Hall and Yarborough or Dranchuk et al. methods. On the basis of this observation, the Hankinson et al. fitting was eliminated from further examination.A comparison of the Hall and Yarborough fitting of the Starling-Carnahan equation of state and the Dranchuk et al. fitting of the BWR with each other and with experimental data showed that both are reasonably accurate when extrapolated to Pr values in excess of 20. However, neither equation is valid at Tr = 1.0 in the vicinity of the critical, and both show marked error increases when extrapolated into the region of Tr < 1.0.The Starling equation of state may be written as(Equation in full paper)and may be generalized and rearranged to express the Z factor as(Equation in full paper)This equation has been shown to be valid in the extended regions for pure components and has been recommended for mixtures(7). In view of this and the equation''s similarity to the BWR equation used in the Dranchuk et at fitting, it was decided to fit Equation (2) to the 1500 data points used in the Dranchuk et al. fitting.},
